# SARS-CoV-2_spike_charge
SARS-CoV-2 spike charge analysis scripts

The repository contains data and scripts used in the manuscript "Evolution to increased positive charge on the viral spike protein may be part of  the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human transmission"  by Cotten and Phan, currently under review at  Virus Evolution and submitted to BioRxiv.

The following files are be included:

Figure 1

Figure 1 data: Figure1_data.csv

Figure 1 Jupyter notebook: Figure1_VOCs_spike_first300_PCA_set4.ipynb

Figure 2

Figure 2 data can be found on Dropbox:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ii1uf0fzyxem3h1/Figure2_data.csv.zip?dl=0

The data file (too large to store on GetHub) can be retrieved from Dropbox, unzipped and loaded in the Figure2 Jupyter notebook to generate Figure 2.
